There was an older implementation before versioning. That's why v0.1 is not
only about added changes. Older implementation is in
[`old_design`](https://github.com/ceyhunsen/ATmega328P-HAL-Driver/tree/old_design)
branch.

### Added

- Multiple new modules:
  - GPIO
  - Power
  - USART

### Changed

- Renamed file and function prefixes from `atmega328p_hal` to `hal`.

  - SPI
  - Timer
  - TWI
  - ADC
