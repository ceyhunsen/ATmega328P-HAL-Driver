# Getting Started

Welcome to the ATmega328P hardware abstraction layer driver documentation. This
driver provides easy to use interface for device peripherals while staying fast
and small as possible.

This driver depends on [avr-libc](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/) and uses
[avr-gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/avr-gcc) as the compiler.
